Each team member submits an individual reflection each week (starting week 1). In the individual reflection, please address the following questions, using the A, B, A -> B reflective loop as described above:
what do I want to learn or understand better?
how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
